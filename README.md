## AID final project

Step-by-step from the [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/pose_classification). Some results available in the `images_for_test` folder

`tenzorflow.py` - copied example from Google Colab, need to be tested on our data

`movenet.py` - working video capturing and drawing predictions

`/unused/` - .py files that do the same, but with some problems; I do not want to delete it right now
