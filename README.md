## AID final project

Step-by-step from the [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/pose_classification). Some results available in the `images_for_test` folder

`pose_classification.py` - step-by-step model training

`dataset/poses.zip` - dataset of poses images

`movenet.py` - working video capturing and drawing predictions

`/unused/` - .py files that do the same, but with some problems; I do not want to delete it right now
