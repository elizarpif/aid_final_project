## AID final project

Step-by-step from the tutorial. Some results available in the images_for_test folder

tenzorflow.py - copied example from Google Colab, need to be tested on our data
movenet.py - working video capturing and drawing predictions
/unused/ - .py files which do the same, but with some problems; I do not want to delete it right now
